# waxom

This is a template that I did to practice markup and bootstrap modals.
One modal emulates subscription, another allows to inspect and edit users' details.
Data about users is taken from random API service.
When a user is clicked, a modal opens and  you can change a user attribute by clicking on it.
Currently template is not adaptive.
